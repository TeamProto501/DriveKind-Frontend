## Database Setup & User Roles Implementation

### 🗄️ Database Schema

I've created a comprehensive Supabase database schema in `database/schema.sql` that includes all the entities you specified:

#### Core Tables:
- **organizations** - Multi-tenant organization management
- **profiles** - Extended user profiles with role-based access
- **rides** - Trip/ride requests and management
- **driver_availability** - Driver scheduling and availability
- **time_off_requests** - Driver time-off management
- **donations** - Donation tracking per ride/client
- **reports** - System reports and analytics
- **audit_logs** - Security and activity logging
- **system_config** - Organization-specific configuration

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant access
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Audit trails and timestamps
- ✅ Role-based access control

### 👥 User Roles Implementation

#### 1. Super Admin
- **Scope**: Global system access
- **Features**:
  - Create and manage organizations
  - Assign head admins to organizations
  - View global dashboard of all organizations
  - System-wide user management
  - Global reports and analytics

#### 2. Admin (Organization Head)
- **Scope**: Single organization
- **Features**:
  - Full organization management
  - User management (dispatchers, drivers, clients)
  - All dispatcher features + admin controls
  - Edit fields, add users, reports, admin tools
  - Database management and configuration

#### 3. Dispatcher
- **Scope**: Organization operations
- **Features**:
  - Manage clients, drivers, volunteers
  - Create and assign ride requests
  - View upcoming/completed/cancelled rides
  - Schedule management
  - Driver availability coordination

#### 4. Driver
- **Scope**: Personal operations
- **Features**:
  - View personal schedule and rides
  - Accept/decline ride assignments
  - Update availability status
  - Request time off
  - View assigned rides and client details

### 🚀 Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Database Setup
1. **Run the SQL schema** in your Supabase dashboard:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of database/schema.sql
   -- into your Supabase SQL editor and execute
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables** (if not already done):
   ```env
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

#### Step 2: Authentication Enhancement
The current authentication system needs to be enhanced to:
- Create user profiles automatically on signup
- Handle role assignment during registration
- Implement proper session management with roles

#### Step 3: Role-Based Navigation
Update the navigation system to show/hide features based on user roles:
- Super Admin: Global organization management
- Admin: Organization-specific admin tools
- Dispatcher: Operational management tools
- Driver: Personal dashboard and ride management

#### Step 4: Page Implementation
Create the missing pages for each role:

**Super Admin Pages:**
- `/super-admin/dashboard` - Global overview
- `/super-admin/organizations` - Organization management
- `/super-admin/create-organization` - New organization setup
- `/super-admin/users` - Global user management

**Dispatcher Pages:**
- `/dispatcher/dashboard` - Operations dashboard
- `/dispatcher/requests` - Ride request management
- `/dispatcher/trips` - Trip database
- `/dispatcher/schedule` - Schedule management
- `/dispatcher/drivers` - Driver management
- `/dispatcher/clients` - Client management

**Driver Pages:**
- `/driver/dashboard` - Personal dashboard
- `/driver/schedule` - Personal schedule
- `/driver/rides` - Assigned rides
- `/driver/availability` - Availability management
- `/driver/time-off` - Time-off requests

### 🔧 Current Status

#### ✅ Completed:
- Database schema design
- TypeScript type definitions
- Basic authentication setup
- Admin pages with mock data
- Navigation system with role-based filtering
- Accessibility fixes

#### 🚧 In Progress:
- Database schema implementation
- Role-based page creation

#### 📋 Next Steps:
1. **Set up Supabase tables** using the provided schema
2. **Create missing role-specific pages**
3. **Implement real data integration** (replace mock data)
4. **Add role-based authentication flows**
5. **Test multi-tenant functionality**

### 🎯 Wireframe Implementation

Based on your wireframes, each role needs specific UI components:

#### Super Admin Dashboard:
- Organization overview cards
- Global statistics
- Quick actions for organization management
- User management interface

#### Dispatcher Interface:
- Ride request queue
- Driver assignment interface
- Client management
- Schedule calendar view
- Real-time ride status updates

#### Driver Interface:
- Personal ride schedule
- Availability toggle
- Time-off request form
- Ride acceptance interface
- Navigation assistance

### 🔐 Security Considerations

The schema includes:
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for multi-tenant data isolation
- **Role-based access policies** for each table
- **Audit logging** for all user actions
- **Secure authentication** through Supabase Auth

### 📊 Data Flow

1. **User Registration** → Profile creation with role assignment
2. **Organization Setup** → Super Admin creates org, assigns head admin
3. **Ride Requests** → Clients request rides through dispatcher
4. **Driver Assignment** → Dispatcher assigns available drivers
5. **Ride Execution** → Driver accepts and completes rides
6. **Reporting** → Generate analytics and reports per organization

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this system?
